<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/quiz-game/header._TTH_.png" />

This sample skill showcase how to find nearby restaurant using Alexa [Geolocation](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/location-services-for-alexa-skills.html) with [Google Place API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview).

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
The front end is the voice interface, or VUI.
The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.

## Three Options for Skill Setup
There are a number of different ways for you to setup your skill, depending on your experience and what tools you have available.

 * If this is your first skill, choose the [Alexa-Hosted](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html) to get started quickly.
 * If you want to manage the backend resources in your own AWS account, you can follow the [AWS-Hosted instructions](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-an-aws-lambda-function.html).
 * Developers with the ASK Command Line Interface configured may follow the [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html).
 * If you want to host the backend code in Alexa developer account (Alexa Hosted skill) then you can directly create hosted skill by [importing Github repository](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/hosted-skills/alexa-hosted-skills-git-import.html).

## Setup to run this demo

**Important:** Use Alexa app in mobile device to launch this skill which will provide user's latitude & longitude details with skill to work.

### How to create Google API key to access Google Place API

* Create Google Developer account and setup account by providing billing details. Remember to select "Google Map Service" and not "Google Cloud service" as billing service.
* Create Google project and enable "Google Place" API.
* Generate API Key and add it in backend code at line 30 as below.
  ```
    API_KEY = ""
  ```
 **Note:** Skill will send Account linking card to your Alexa app if location permission not granted.
